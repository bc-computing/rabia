Shell configurations explained with design rationales

ServerIps:
    Rabia servers' IP addresses (usually internal IPs)
    A note on ServerIps:
        If the length of ServerIps is less than the number of servers (set below), say len(ServerIps) = 5 and NServers = 7:
            Rabia server 0 and server 5 are instantiated on the 1st VM (i.e., the VM with the first IP);
            Rabia server 1 and server 6 are instantiated on the 2nd VM;
            Rabia server 2 is instantiated on the 3rd VM;
            Rabia server 3 is instantiated on the 4th VM;
            Rabia server 4 is instantiated on the 5th VM.
        If len(ServerIps) = 7 and NServers = 5:
            Rabia server 0 is instantiated on the 1st VM;
            Rabia server 1 is instantiated on the 2nd VM;
            Rabia server 2 is instantiated on the 3rd VM;
            Rabia server 3 is instantiated on the 4th VM;
            Rabia server 4 is instantiated on the 5th VM;
            6th VM has no Rabia server instantiated;
            7th VM has no Rabia server instantiated.

ClientIps:
    Rabia clients' IP addresses (usually internal IPs)
    A note on ClientIps, if Rabia_ClientDistributingMethod is set to modulo
        If the length of ClientIps is less than the number of clients (set below), say len(ClientIps) = 3 and NClients = 20:
            Rabia clientids 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 are instantiated on the 1st client VM (i.e., the VM with the first IP);
            Rabia clientids 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19 are instantiated on the 2nd client VM
            Rabia clientids 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17 are instantiated on the 3nd client VM
        If len(ServerIps) = 3 and NClients = 2:
            Rabia client 0 is instantiated on the 1st VM;
            Rabia client 1 is instantiated on the 2nd VM;
            3rd VM has no Rabia clientid instantiated;

Controller:
    the benchmark controller's address (IP:port)

ProxyStartPort:
    Rabia server 0's proxy listener port, 1's proxy listener port is this number + 1, and so on so forth

NetworkStartPort:
    Rabia server 0's peer networking port, 1's peer networking is this number + 1, and so on so forth
    Why we ask ports for server 0 only:
        If we want to run Rabia servers and clients on a single VM, each of server/client needs to have unique ports;
        If we want to run Rabia servers and clients on a set of VMs, each of server/client may or may not use unique ports.
        So the setting ports is complicated and error-prone. To simplify the process, we decided that a user only need to 
        specify the ports for the first server and let Shell code figure out some always non-conflicting ports for other servers.

User:
    VM's user, e.g., root, name_bc_edu...

RCFolder:
    the path to the project's root directory
    NOTE: ending the path with a slash (/) is not required

RCLogLevel:
    warn | debug | info, only messages of and above this level will be logged
    
Rabia_ClosedLoop: 
    true | false, whether initiate closed-loop clients or open-loop clients

Rabia_ClientDistributingMethod:
  modulo: 
    clients then are distributed evenly across servers. 
    If there are 5 servers and 3 clients: 
        server 0 gets client 0
        server 1 gets client 2
        server 2 gets client 2;
    If there are 3 servers and 5 clients: 
        server 0 gets client 0, 3 
        server 1 gets client 2, 4
        server 2 gets client 2.
  ad-hoc: 
    the script user needs to specify the number of clients at each server through an array of length NServer called Rabia_ClientsPerServer

Rabia_ClientsPerServer:
  If "ad-hoc" is selected, the length of the array needs to be equal to the number of servers (NServers), 
  and the sum of entries needs to be equal to the number of clients (NClients).
  Otherwise (i.e., when "modulo" is selected), this array is disregarded.

NServers:             the number of servers (usually 2*NFaulty+1 or 4*NFaulty+1)
NFaulty:              the number of faulty servers (could be 0, 1, 2, ..., usually < floor((NServers-1)/2), in other words, f is less than the majority of servers)
NClients:             the number of clients (could be 1, 2, 3, ..., usually < 500)
NConcurrency:         concurrency -- the number of consensus instances (could be 1, 2, 3, ..., usually 1)
ClientTimeout:        the maximum time a client can run in seconds before it terminates (works only for closed-loop clients and has no effect on open-loop clients) (usually 60 or 180)
ClientThinkTime:      the time the client waits in between sending two requests in millisecond (ms) (could be 0, 1, 2, ..., usually 0)
ClientBatchSize:      the num. of write commands packed in a single client request (could be 1, 2, 3, ..., usually 1)
ProxyBatchSize:       the max. num. of client-batched requests in a consensus object (could be 1, 2, 3, ..., usually 1, 10, 100, 1000)
ProxyBatchTimeout:    (in milliseconds) a proxy sends a ConsensusObj when timed out or receives enough client-batched requests such that len(clientbatchedrequests) = proxybatchsize (could be 1, 2, 3, ..., usually 5)
NetworkBatchSize:     a reserved variable
NetworkBatchTimeout:  a reserved variable
NClientRequests:      if set to 0, then it becomes the default value 10000000 -- a very large number
                      if open-loop: the number of un-batched requests per client (1, 2, 3, ... usually 10000 or 100000);
                      if closed-loop: a client times out after reaching ClientTimeout time or receiving this many un-batched requests (usually 0 and use ClientTimeout to control the runtime)
